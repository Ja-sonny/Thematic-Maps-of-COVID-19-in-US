# Thematic Maps of COVID-19 in US
For this lab we were able to navigate through the introductory skills of Mapbox library in Javascript. With the Mapbox library, I was able to create two maps. One is a 2020 Covid-19 case count by county proportional symbols map and the other is a 2020 Covid-19 rates by county choropleth map.
